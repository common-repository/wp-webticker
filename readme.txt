Display a rotating list of latest post in a particular category using shortcode.

== Description ==

wp-webticker is a plugin that provides shortcode functionality to use the jQuery webTicker.

The jQuery webTicker is a jQuery plugin that creates a ticker effect where posts slide from one side to another in a particular order
once the last item goes outside of the visible area it is queued back so that it will appear when the list finishes. The ticker can be used 
to show the users the latest posts in your blog/website without having space consuming widgets on the sidebars.

This makes creating web tickers on your wordpress blog quite easily. You can either use the shortcode in Advanced Text 
widget plugin; or else include it in a post/page or in the template itself using do_shortcode.

Further information and an example can be found on the official [wp-webticker page](http://jonmifsud.com/web-tools/wp-webticker/ "Wordpress webTicker").

Add the following shortcode in your post/page)

[webticker num="3" category="1,3" id="webticker", direction="1", speed="0.05" ]


If used in a template please include the shortcode function
 
do_shortcode('[webticker num="3" category="1,3" id="webticker", direction="1", speed="0.05", link="yes" ]');

 * num 			- your total number of post to display. default is 10
 * category		- category id. use comma , for multiple id
 * orderby 		- your post will order by . default post_date . check http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/get_posts for detail
 * id			- the id that you would like to give to the webticker list (has to be used when running multiple tickers on same page)
 * speed 		- the speed should be in the domain of 0 - 1 
 * direction	- 1 = left to right; and -1 = right to left.
 * link			- yes = link back to author site; hide = hide link; no = remove link completely. 
 
 If you remove the link it would be appriciated if you write something about this plugin.
